aufs : multi-layered unification filesystem

An union filesystem takes an existing filesystem and transparently overlays it on a newer filesystem. It allows files and directories of separate filesystem to co-exist under a single roof. AuFS can merge several directories and provide a single merged view of it

Kernel version 3 support aufs

O

OverlayFs : Smillar aufs but faster and simple then. 

Advised to use Overlay2
Overlay2 is more efficient becuause of inode utilization, required version 4.0 higer of linux kernel


R

race condition : 

A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence in order to be done correctly.
