aufs : multi-layered unification filesystem

An union filesystem takes an existing filesystem and transparently overlays it on a newer filesystem. It allows files and directories of separate filesystem to co-exist under a single roof. AuFS can merge several directories and provide a single merged view of it

Kernel version 3 support aufs

O

OverlayFs : Smillar aufs but faster and simple then. 

Advised to use Overlay2
Overlay2 is more efficient becuause of inode utilization, required version 4.0 higer of linux kernel
