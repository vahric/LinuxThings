1) u
2) f
3) o (VAAI STATS)


    CLONE_RD – number of successfully completed CLONE commands where disk device was a source
    CLONE_WR – number of successfully completed CLONE commands where disk device was a destination
    CLONE_F – number of failed CLONE commands
    MBC_RD/s – CLONE data read per second (in MB)
    MBC_WR/s – CLONE data written per second (in MB)

Note:
CLONE_F  shows failed VAAI commands and should be zero. CLONE_F > 0 implies that there is/was a constraint on the array. In this case ESX will fail back to a software copy.

    ATS – number of successfully completed ATS (Atomic Test & Set) commands
    ATSF – number of failed ATS commands

Note:
If you see ATSF values > 0 it is not a problem in the short run. It only means that ESX falls back to SCSI-2 reservations for metadata updates for any reason. If you see SCSI reservation conflicts in a high number in the /var/log/vmkernel log you should give them a look.

    ZERO – number of successfully completed ZERO commands
    ZERO_F – number of failed ZERO commands
    MBZERO/s – data zeroed per second (in MB)

    DELETE – number of sucessfully completed DELETE commands
    DELETE_F – number of failed DELETE commands
    MBDEL/s – data deleted per second (in MB)
