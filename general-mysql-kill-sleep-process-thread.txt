To kill all Sleeps :D 

mysql -u<Username> -p<password> -e "show processlist;" | grep Sleep | awk '{print $1}' | while read LINE; do mysql -u<Username> -p<password> -e "kill $LINE"; done 

Not : Sometime because special characters you need to set pass inside ' ' 

Also configure your my.cnf and via cli to reduce or kill Sleeps quick as possible

[mysqld]
interactive_timeout=180
wait_timeout=180


cli>
SET interactive_timeout = 180;
SET wait_timeout = 180;
