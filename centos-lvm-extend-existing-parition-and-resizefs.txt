Our environment is VMware and extended already existing disk which is dedicated to root partition.

Not: Better way is add additional disk and extend volume group with this new disk.

1) Extend disk from vSphere,vCenter or vCD

2) Use fdisk to extend related partition for example "fdisk /dev/sda" (or use whats your)

3) Delete existing partition with "d" (not root partition, related LVM partition )and recreate with "n" no need to touch anything just "n" and enter,enter,enter and "w" and out to save.
Not: Don't worry no any data will gone somewhere.

4) Execute "partprobe" to re-read partition tables by system to no need restart vm.

5) pvresize /dev/sda2 (or use whats your)

6) Lets resize logical volume too ! lvresize -l +100%FREE /dev/centos/root

7) Because of Centos 7 use xfs use xfs_growfs to resize file system like xfs_growfs /dev/centos/root

8) Check it via "df -h" or/and "vgdisplay" commands ... 


if you will add additiona disks to system

1) Use fdisk to create partition

2) pvcreate /dev/sdex

3) vgdisplay

4) vgextend <volume group name> /dev/sde1

5) pvscan

6) lvdisplay

7a) lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/vg_metcalf/lv_root
7b) lvextend /dev/Mega/root /dev/sdb1
7c) lvextend -L +2G /dev/mapper/vg_cloud-LogVol00

8a) resize2fs /dev/<volume group name> /lv_root
8b) xfs_growfs /dev/<volume group name>
