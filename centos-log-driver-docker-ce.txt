Docker support multiple log drivers
Logs are very important to see whats happening
Handling single docker container logs should be easy but for multiple containers its hard to manage

You can see the each container logs with command bellow

docker logs <container_name/id>

[root@centostest1 ~]# docker logs e6
AH00558: httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 172.17.0.2. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message

**For services run docker service logs

Default docker user json-file log driver , other closer one is journald and only this two support docker logs command

But mostly you would like to get out logs to syslog or others like aws , fluentd , logstash all these are supported with two options

Option 1
Use daemon.json to configure globally 

First check already running config 

[root@centostest1 ~]# docker info | grep "Logging Driver"
Logging Driver: json-file

and modify Logging Driver

{
  "storage-driver": "devicemapper",
  "storage-opts": [
    "dm.directlvm_device=/dev/sdb",
    "dm.thinp_percent=95",
    "dm.thinp_metapercent=1",
    "dm.thinp_autoextend_threshold=80",
    "dm.thinp_autoextend_percent=20",
    "dm.directlvm_device_force=false"
  ],
  "log-driver":"syslog"
}


[root@centostest1 ~]# docker info | grep "Logging Driver"
Logging Driver: syslog

Actually you can configure more like set syslog server and port bla bla 

{
  "log-driver": "syslog",
  "log-opts": {
    "syslog-address": "udp://1.2.3.4:1111"
  }
}


Option 2

More quick and special thing you need then go and give a parameters on command prompt when run docker container

Example

docker run -–log-driver syslog –-log-opt syslog-address=udp://1.2.3.4:1111 alpine echo hello world
